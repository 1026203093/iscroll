iScroll v4.0 dev. rel.
======================

Please note that this is a *development release* not ready for production. I'm making this public to receive your feedback and bug fixes. If you are looking for a stable version please check [my blog](http://cubiq.org/iscroll).

At the moment the priority is to have the basic scroller as solid as possible, especially on Android. Scrolling seems now extremely smooth on Android (2.1/2.2), please test it on your device and let me know.

## About

The overflow:scroll for mobile webkit. Project started because webkit for iPhone does not provide a native way to scroll content inside a fixed size (width/height) div. So basically it was impossible to have a fixed header/footer and a scrolling central area. Until now.
